## Road Ahead

Next.js provides us with an easy way to craft static and dynamic web apps that are fast and cheap with easy integration to a headless CMS.

With this sample implementation as a POC, we can extend it by adding more dynamic features such as and not limited to - 

 - A social platform integrated with existing channels (such as slack or teams), which can be used for personalized interactive chats or real-time virtual polls.
 - A complete HRMS system with features such as  - 
	- Employee Dashboard, Leave Management, Timesheets, Attendance
	- Client and Project Management
	- Support Ticket Management
	- HR Payrolls, Policies, Jobs and Recruitment System
